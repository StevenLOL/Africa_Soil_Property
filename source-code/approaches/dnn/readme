Here is the package from Rasmus Berg Palm source code @

    https://github.com/rasmusbergpalm/DeepLearnToolbox

Its readme file and example in file READMEV2.md

The most important sciprts are:

dnn_five_target.m                       %predict all five target in one shot
dnn_fullfeature_improvement_ws09.m      %predict targets one by one

If you have a good GPU, kindly set hasgpu=1;


To make it runnable, you must have a file named "matlab.mat" in this folder.

Which is just the csv data from Kaggle, we save it as mat format, the speed for loading is faster than reading from csv.

The submission folder contains all our submissions under DNN.
