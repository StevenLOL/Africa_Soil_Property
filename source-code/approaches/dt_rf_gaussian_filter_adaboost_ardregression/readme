We test many regressors for this task, not all of them give good result, the SVR approach shows better result than others.


You can find sklearn package Here:

    http://scikit-learn.org/stable/
    To install
    sudo pip install scikit-learn

You also need the pandas, or nose 

    sudo pip install pandas nose

You should have scipy and numpy installed as well if not
    
    sudo pip install scipy numpy
    
Plase see the approach_1_modelEval.py for details including cross validation on all approach one by one,and make predition:

    approach_1_modelEval.py   
    

The beest result is SVR approach.
The above script will produce a cross validation score for each regression methods, and one submission file for each.



There are also other files in this folder, illustrate different usage of regressors:
    
    approach_dt.py         DecisionTreeRegressor
    
    approach_sp.py         SVR remove all co2 and depth      0.40861  

    approach_sp_derivative_gaussian_filter.py    first derivative with gaussian filter

    approach_rf.py         RandomForestRegressor

    approach_adaboost.py    ADAboost

    approach_ardregression.py ARDRegression


Why there are many simlar files with different regressor ? They actually running indepdently on different PCs with same framework. 

Because we use GIT , using different file for different task will be easy to commit changes in GIT,there will be less conflict caused by modify one files via different clients.
